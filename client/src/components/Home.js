No content would be reachable without properly designed navigation that answers the questions “where am I?” and “where can I go from here?”. We got used to either a top, left or right menu. They’re patterns used since the beginning of the web.

Something changed in 2013 though. Designers started to play with the concept and come up with really creative solutions. Some of them are more usable (bottom navigation), some less (usage of a keyboard in navigating through a website), but all in all this is an interesting and popular trend that’s changing the way the Internet looks.

Designers and Web Developers that are using UXPin – The UX Design App reported many time this year, that using non-standard navigation is a major and still growing design trend that is loved by their customers. It certainly catches an eye and in some.

CSS helps us to control the display of images in web applications. The centering of images or texts is a common task in CSS. To center an image, we have to set the value of margin-left and margin-right to auto and make it a block element by using the display: block; property.

If the image is in the div element, then we can use the text-align: center; property for aligning the image to center in the div.
